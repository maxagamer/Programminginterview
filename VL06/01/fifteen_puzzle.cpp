// The 15-puzzle is a very popular game: you have certainly seen it even if you
// don't know it by that name. It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each
// with a different number from 1 to 15, with all tiles packed into a 4 by 4
// frame with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles
// so that they are ordered as below:
//
//  +---+---+---+---+
//  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
//  +---+---+---+---+
//  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
//  +---+---+---+---+
//  | 9 | 10| 11| 12|
//  +---+---+---+---+
//  | 13| 14| 15|   |
//  +---+---+---+---+
//    final state
//
// The only legal operation is to exchange the missing tile with one of the 2,
// 3, or 4 tiles it shares an edge with. Consider the following sequence of
// moves:
//
//  +---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+
//  | 2 | 12| 11| 14|  | 2 | 12| 11| 14|  | 2 | 12| 11| 14|  | 2 | 12| 11| 14|

// We denote moves by the neighbor of the missing tile is swapped with it. Legal
// values are 'R', 'L', 'U', and 'D' for right, left, up, and down, based on the
// movements of the hole. Given an initial configuration of a 15-puzzle you must
// determine a sequence of steps that take you to the final state. Each solvable
// 15-puzzle input requires at most 80 steps to be solved. Here, you can assume
// that the input puzzle always has a solution.
//
// Your task is simply to find a valid solution for a given puzzle that always
// needs less than 200 moves. (As soon as you realize with a heuristic that a
// move would lead to a solution that has more than 200 moves, prune the move
// away.)
//
// A solution is basically a sequence of movements until reaching the final
// state of the puzzle. (R,D,L,L,U, ....)
// Google the "15 puzzle" if you are still unsure what it's about.

// Look at the class defined in line 34, you will use its public interface.
// Your friend also tried to adapt the backtracking approach to solve the 15
// puzzle.

// candidate moves is the part where your friend needs your help.

        //   to the set "visited_game_states", so next time you can check if you've

        //   may help you to solve the problem (for example manhattan distance,
        //   you can also make your own measure)
        //   (in our case a small distance is good --> we sort moves based on
        //   distance below)
        // - now the most important part: you need to prune moves away that would
        //   lead to a solution that has more than 200 moves (for example the
        //   manhattan distance can be used as a lower bound to compute the amount
        //   of moves needed until we finish --> add the lower bound to the moves
        //   count you already have to decide if a move should be pruned away)
