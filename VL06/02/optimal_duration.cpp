/************** begin assignment **************/
// We consider the problem of assigning tasks to workers. Each worker must be
// assigned exactly two tasks. Each task takes a fixed amount of time. Tasks are
// independent, that is, there are no constraints of the form "Task 4 cannot
// start before Task 3 is completed." Any task can be assigned to any worker. We
// want to assign tasks to workers so as to minimize how long it takes before
// all tasks are completed. For example, if there are 6 tasks whose durations
// are 5, 2, 1, 6, 4, 4 hours, then an optimum assignment is to give the first
// two tasks (that is, the tasks with duration 5 and 2) to one worker, the next
// two (1 and 6) to another worker, and the last two tasks (4 and 4) to the last
// worker. For this assignment, all tasks will finish after
// max(5 + 2, 1 + 6, 4 + 4) = 8 hours. Design an algorithm that takes as input a
// set of tasks and returns the time after all tasks will finish in an optimum
// assignment. In our example the answer would be 8.
//
// hints:
//      - Simply enumerating all possible sets of pairs of tasks is not
//      feasible, there are too many of them --> n!/2^(n/2), where n is the
//      number of tasks
//      - Sorting the tasks by its durations first, helps you to design an
//      optimal greedy strategy.
//      - With which task would you pair the task with the longest duration?
//      - With which task would you pair the task with the second longest
//      duration? And so on ...

// vector "tasks" contains for each task the duration
// (there is an even number of tasks,
// a single task duration is between 0 and 10000)
