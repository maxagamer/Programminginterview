// Dynamic programming is a very important problem solving strategy in
// competitive programming problems.
//
// In the backtracking assignment you had to work with code you didn't write.
// In this assignment you write everything yourself from the beginning.
//
// TODO: Read chapter 7 from the "Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook"
// https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf --> pp. 65 - 76
// TODO: Choose one of the three following problems presented in the book:
//       - Longest increasing subsequence
//       - Paths in a grid
//       - Knapsack (all possible sums)
//       Implement for your chosen problem with dynamic programming
//       1. an iterative solution
//                and
//       2. a recursive solution
//       Test your implementations thoroughly. Start by writing your test cases
//       before you implement the algorithms.
//       Document your solutions thoroughly by writing meaningful comments.
